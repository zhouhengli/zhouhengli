<p style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;"> 
    <span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 2em;">I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the College of Control Science and Engineering at <img src="./ico/zju.jpg" style="width: 16px; height: auto;" /> Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, under the supervision of  <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=7ZZ_-m0AAAAJ" target=_blank  >Prof. Lei Xie</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9rfFRjgAAAAJ" target=_blank  >Prof. Hongye Su</a>. 
    I will be visiting the <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/" target=_blank  >Kempner Institute</a> at <img src="./ico/harvard.jpg" style="width: 14px; height: auto;" /> 
    Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) starting in December 2025, supervised by <a href="https://yilundu.github.io/" target=_blank  >Prof. Yilun Du</a>. During the visit, my research will focus on safe, high-mobility trajectory planning methods with out-of-distribution generalization ability.
<span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 2em;">Before joining Zhejiang University, I interned at Hikvision Research Institute in Hangzhou, where I applied optimization methods for manipulators with ROS. ✨ Enjoyments of life: 🎲 Board Games (Splendor, Seven Wonders: Duel, etc), 👣 hiking, 🎾 tennis, 🏓 ping-pong, 🗺️ traveling. </span>

    <span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 2em;">My ultimate goal is to develop embodied intelligent vehicles capable of seamlessly interacting with the physical world. To achieve this, my research focuses on decision-making methods powered by generative models and optimization-based trajectory planning methods designed for afety. Currently, I am exploring planning approaches for both single and multi-vehicle systems in autonomous racing and drifting, with a focus on the following key areas:</span> <br>
    <span style="display: inline-block;">⭐ <strong>afe Decision-Making and planning Using Generative Models</strong>: Using energy-based models (EBMs) for decision-making, while ensuring afety through model-based planning methods.</span> <br>  
    <span style="display: inline-block;">⭐ <strong>Integrated Trajectory Planning and Control</strong>: Aggressive vehicle motion is guaranteed by optimizing the velocity distribution within the MPC prediction horizon when planning racing trajectories.</span> <br>     
    <span style="display: inline-block;">⭐ <strong>Learning-Based Parameter Tuning for Motion Planners</strong>: Leveraging post-race data to optimize planner performance and push the boundaries of the vehicle's racing capabilities.</span>  <br>   
    <span style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 2em;">I am also actively involved in applying these techniques to <a href="https://f1tenth.org/" style="text-decoration: none;" target=_blank >F1TENTH competition</a>. <strong>Feel free to drop me emails</strong> (📨 zh.li@zju.edu.cn) if you are interested in the topics mentioned above, I would be happy to discuss further collaborations.</span>
